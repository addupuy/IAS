# IAS
Integration Analysis System

The Integration Analysis System (IAS) is a set of three software tools that are designed to take raw sequence data derived from cell-based phenotypic screens using the Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis system, as described by Feddersen et al. (Feddersen et al. 2019). This study describes a ligation-mediated PCR approach that generates two independent libraries for each sample analyzed corresponding to the genomic/transposon junction derived from the left (IRL) and right (IRR) inverted repeats of the transposon. After multiplexing, these libraries are then sequenced using a paired-end approach on the Illumina platform, ultimately producing four FASTQ files for each sample (i.e. forward and reverse reads for both IRL and IRR). The IAS is designed to take these raw sequence files as input and produce a list of candidate genes that are associated with the phenotype of interest.
